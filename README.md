# Marble Maze

## Overview
Marble Maze is a JavaScript-based marble maze simulator game.  The player tilts the maze board to make the marble roll and guide it to the finish while avoiding holes.

## Functionality & MVPs
* Players can use the arrow keys or WASD to control the x and y-axis tilt of the board
  * e.g. Pressing A will cause the board to tilt 1 degree to the left
  * The board maintains its tilt
* Falling into a hole causes the board to reset
* Completing a maze takes the player to a new maze
* The game display rotates on the x and y-axes to reflect the tilt of the board.
